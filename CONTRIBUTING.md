- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

### Component Development

- Create components in the `app/Components` directory
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript types
- Follow the existing styling patterns using Tailwind CSS

### State Management

- Use React Context for global state
- Keep component state local when possible
- Follow the existing context patterns

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Test across different screen sizes

## Pull Request Process

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes and commit them

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```
3. Push to your fork
